Where the people did not dwell;

They had gone unto the wars,

Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,

Nightly, from their azure towers,

To keep watch above the flowers,

In the midst of which all day

The red sun-light lazily lay.

Now each visitor shall confess

The sad valley's restlessness.

Nothing there is motionless --

Nothing save the airs that brood

Over the magic solitude.

Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees

That palpitate like the chill seas

Around the misty Hebrides!

Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven

That rustle through the unquiet Heaven

Uneasily, from morn till even,

Over the violets there that lie

In myriad types of the human eye --

Over the lilies there that wave

And weep above a nameless grave!

They wave: -- from out their fragrant tops

Eternal dews come down in drops.

They weep: -- from off their delicate stems

Perennial tears descend in gems."

     Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,

Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies

     Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.

Search narrowly the lines! -- they hold a treasure

     Divine -- a talisman -- an amulet

That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure --

     The words -- the syllables! Do not forget

The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!

     And yet there is in this no Gordian knot

Which one might not undo without a sabre,

     If one could merely comprehend the plot.

Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering

     Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdu,

Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing

     Of poets, by poets -- as the name is a poet's, too.

Its letters, although naturally lying

     Like the knight Pinto -- Mendez Ferdinando --

Still form a synonym for Truth. -- Cease trying!

     You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.

  In old Alberto's daughter;



But when within thy wave she looks --

        Which glistens then, and trembles --

Why, then, the prettiest of brooks

For in my heart, as in thy stream,

    Her image deeply lies --

The heart which trembles at the beam

In death around thee --  and their will

For the night -- tho' clear -- shall frown --

And the stars shall look not down,

From their high thrones in the Heaven,

With light like Hope to mortals given --

But their red orbs, without beam,

To thy weariness shall seem

As a burning and a fever

Which would cling to thee for ever :



Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish --

Now are visions ne'er to vanish --

From thy spirit shall they pass

No more -- like dew-drop from the grass:



The breeze -- the breath of God -- is still --

And the mist upon the hill

Shadowy -- shadowy -- yet unbroken,

Is a symbol and a token --

How it hangs upon the trees,

A mystery of mysteries! --"

I stand beneath the mystic moon. 

An opiate vapor, dewy, dim, 

Exhales from out her golden rim, 

And, softly dripping, drop by drop, 

Upon the quiet mountain top, 

Steals drowsily and musically 

Into the universal valley. 

The rosemary nods upon the grave; 

The lily lolls upon the wave; 

Wrapping the fog about its breast, 

The ruin molders into rest; 

Looking like Lethe, see! the lake 

A conscious slumber seems to take, 

And would not, for the world, awake. 

All Beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies 

Irene, with her Destinies!

 

O, lady bright! can it be right- 

This window open to the night? 

The wanton airs, from the tree-top, 

Laughingly through the lattice drop- 

The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, 

Flit through thy chamber in and out, 

And wave the curtain canopy 

So fitfully- so fearfully- 

Above the closed and fringed lid 

'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, 

That, o'er the floor and down the wall, 

Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! 

Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? 

Why and what art thou dreaming here? 

Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas, 

A wonder to these garden trees! 

Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress, 

Strange, above all, thy length of tress, 

And this all solemn silentness! 



The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, 

Which is enduring, so be deep! 

Heaven have her in its sacred keep! 

This chamber changed for one more holy, 

This bed for one more melancholy, 

I pray to God that she may lie 

For ever with unopened eye, 

While the pale sheeted ghosts go by! 



My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep 

As it is lasting, so be deep! 

Soft may the worms about her creep! 

Far in the forest, dim and old, 

For her may some tall vault unfold- 

Some vault that oft has flung its black 

And winged panels fluttering back, 

Triumphant, o'er the crested palls, 

Of her grand family funerals- 



Some sepulchre, remote, alone, 

Against whose portal she hath thrown, 

In childhood, many an idle stone- 

Some tomb from out whose sounding door 

She ne'er shall force an echo more, 

Thrilling to think, poor child of sin! 

It was the dead who groaned within."

   By good angels tenanted, 

Once a fair and stately palace- 

   Radiant palace- reared its head. 

In the monarch Thought's dominion- 

   It stood there! 

Never seraph spread a pinion 

   Over fabric half so fair! 

Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 

   On its roof did float and flow, 

(This- all this- was in the olden 

   Time long ago,) 

And every gentle air that dallied, 

   In that sweet day, 

Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 

   A winged odor went away. 



Wanderers in that happy valley, 

   Through two luminous windows, saw 

Spirits moving musically, 

   To a lute's well-tuned law, 

Round about a throne where, sitting 

   (Porphyrogene!) 

In state his glory well-befitting, 

   The ruler of the realm was seen. 



And all with pearl and ruby glowing 

   Was the fair palace door, 

Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, 

   And sparkling evermore, 

A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty 

   Was but to sing, 

In voices of surpassing beauty, 

   The wit and wisdom of their king. 



But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 

   Assailed the monarch's high estate. 

(Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow 

   Shall dawn upon him desolate!) 

And round about his home the glory 

   That blushed and bloomed, 

Is but a dim-remembered story 

   Of the old time entombed. 



And travellers, now, within that valley, 

   Through the red-litten windows see 

Vast forms, that move fantastically 

   To a discordant melody, 

While, like a ghastly rapid river, 

   Through the pale door 

A hideous throng rush out forever 

   And laugh- but smile no more."

    The danger is past,

And the lingering illness

    Is over at last --

And the fever called ""Living""

    Is conquered at last.



Sadly, I know

    I am shorn of my strength,

And no muscle I move

    As I lie at full length --

But no matter! -- I feel

    I am better at length.



And I rest so composedly,

    Now, in my bed,

That any beholder

    Might fancy me dead --

Might start at beholding me,

    Thinking me dead.



The moaning and groaning,

    The sighing and sobbing,

Are quieted now,

    With that horrible throbbing

At heart: -- ah, that horrible,

    Horrible throbbing!



The sickness -- the nausea --

    The pitiless pain --

Have ceased, with the fever

    That maddened my brain --

With the fever called ""Living""

    That burned in my brain.



And oh! of all tortures

    That torture the worst

Has abated -- the terrible

    Torture of thirst

For the naphthaline river

    Of Passion accurst: --

I have drank of a water

    That quenches all thirst: --



Of a water that flows,

    With a lullaby sound,

From a spring but a very few

    Feet under ground --

From a cavern not very far

    Down under ground.



And ah! let it never

    Be foolishly said

That my room it is gloomy

    And narrow my bed;

For man never slept

    In a different bed --

And, to sleep, you must slumber

    In just such a bed.



My tantalized spirit

    Here blandly reposes,

Forgetting, or never

    Regretting its roses --

Its old agitations

    Of myrtles and roses:



For now, while so quietly

    Lying, it fancies

A holier odor

    About it, of pansies --

A rosemary odor,

    Commingled with pansies --

With rue and the beautiful

    Puritan pansies.



And so it lies happily,

    Bathing in many

A dream of the truth

    And the beauty of Annie --

Drowned in a bath

    Of the tresses of Annie.



She tenderly kissed me,

    She fondly caressed,

And then I fell gently

    To sleep on her breast --

Deeply to sleep

    From the heaven of her breast.



When the light was extinguished,

    She covered me warm,

And she prayed to the angels

    To keep me from harm --

To the queen of the angels

    To shield me from harm.



And I lie so composedly,

    Now in my bed,

(Knowing her love)

    That you fancy me dead --

And I rest so contentedly,

    Now in my bed,

(With her love at my breast)

    That you fancy me dead --

That you shudder to look at me,

    Thinking me dead: --



But my heart it is brighter

    Than all of the many

Stars in the sky,

    For it sparkles with Annie --

It glows with the light

    Of the love of my Annie --

With the thought of the light

    Of the eyes of my Annie."

          Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.



    Bottomless vales and boundless floods,

    And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,

    With forms that no man can discover

    For the dews that drip all over;

    Mountains toppling evermore

    Into seas without a shore;

    Seas that restlessly aspire,

    Surging, unto skies of fire;

Sit in a theatre, to see 

   A play of hopes and fears, 

While the orchestra breathes fitfully 

   The music of the spheres. 

Mimes, in the form of God on high, 

   Mutter and mumble low,

And seraphs sob at vermin fangs

Out- out are the lights- out all!

In a strange city lying alone 

Far down within the dim West, 

Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best 

Have gone to their eternal rest. 

There shrines and palaces and towers 

(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) 

Resemble nothing that is ours. 

Around, by lifting winds forgot, 

Resignedly beneath the sky 

The melancholy waters lie. 

No rays from the holy heaven come down 

On the long night-time of that town; 

But light from out the lurid sea 

Streams up the turrets silently- 

Gleams up the pinnacles far and free- 

Up domes- up spires- up kingly halls- 

Up fanes- up Babylon-like walls- 

Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers 

Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers- 

Up many and many a marvellous shrine 

Whose wreathed friezes intertwine 

The viol, the violet, and the vine. 

Resignedly beneath the sky 

The melancholy waters lie. 

So blend the turrets and shadows there 

That all seem pendulous in air, 

While from a proud tower in the town 

Death looks gigantically down. 



There open fanes and gaping graves 

Yawn level with the luminous waves; 

But not the riches there that lie 

In each idol's diamond eye- 

Not the gaily-jewelled dead 

Tempt the waters from their bed; 

For no ripples curl, alas! 

Along that wilderness of glass- 

No swellings tell that winds may be 

Upon some far-off happier sea- 

No heavings hint that winds have been 

On seas less hideously serene. 



But lo, a stir is in the air! 

The wave- there is a movement there! 

As if the towers had thrust aside, 

In slightly sinking, the dull tide- 

As if their tops had feebly given 

A void within the filmy Heaven. 

The waves have now a redder glow- 

The hours are breathing faint and low- 

And when, amid no earthly moans, 

Down, down that town shall settle hence, 

Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, 

Shall do it reverence."

            From the rust within their throats

                    Is a groan.

"1680543001-87","https://poestories.com/poetry.php","""Annabel Lee""","https://poestories.com/read/annabellee","It was many and many a year ago, 

   In a kingdom by the sea, 

That a maiden there lived whom you may know 

   By the name of ANNABEL LEE;-- 

And this maiden she lived with no other thought 

   Than to love and be loved by me. 

She was a child and I was a child, 

   In this kingdom by the sea, 

But we loved with a love that was more than love-- 

   I and my Annabel Lee-- 

With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven 

   Coveted her and me. 



And this was the reason that, long ago, 

   In this kingdom by the sea, 

A wind blew out of a cloud by night 

   Chilling my Annabel Lee; 

So that her high-born kinsman came 

   And bore her away from me, 

To shut her up in a sepulchre 

   In this kingdom by the sea. 



The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 

   Went envying her and me:-- 

Yes! that was the reason (as all men know, 

   In this kingdom by the sea) 

That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling 

   And killing my Annabel Lee. 



But our love it was stronger by far than the love 

   Of those who were older than we-- 

   Of many far wiser than we- 

And neither the angels in Heaven above, 

   Nor the demons down under the sea, 

Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 

   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:-- 



For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams 

   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 

And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes 

   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 

And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 

Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride, 

   In her sepulchre there by the sea-- 

   In her tomb by the side of the sea."

As others were -- I have not seen

As others saw -- I could not bring

My passions from a common spring --

From the same source I have not taken

My sorrow -- I could not awaken

My heart to joy at the same tone --

And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --

Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn

Of a most stormy life -- was drawn

From ev'ry depth of good and ill

The mystery which binds me still --

From the torrent, or the fountain --

From the red cliff of the mountain --

From the sun that 'round me roll'd

In its autumn tint of gold --

From the lightning in the sky

As it pass'd me flying by --

From the thunder, and the storm --

And the cloud that took the form

(When the rest of Heaven was blue)

Of a demon in my view --





NOTES:

Poe wrote this poem in the autograph album of Lucy Holmes, later Lucy Holmes Balderston. The poem was never printed during Poe's lifetime. It was first published by E. L. Didier in Scribner's Monthly for September of 1875, in the form of a facsimile. The facsimile, however, included the addition of a title and date not on the original manuscript. That title was ""Alone,"" which has remained. Doubts about its authenticity, in part inspired by this manipulation, have since been calmed. The poem is now seen as one of Poe's most revealing works.
